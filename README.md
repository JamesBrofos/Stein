# Stein

A library for general Bayesian inference using Stein variational gradient descent.


## Experiments

These are the experiments that will be included in the paper.

1. Bayesian linear regression. Show that particle sharing is necessary in order for inference to be correct.
2. Repeat experimentation on 1-D Gaussian mixture distribution. Compute expected value of X, X^2, and cos(w x X + b) where w ~ is N(0, 1) and b ~ U(0, 2 x pi).
3. Bayesian neural network performance should replicate the experiments of the papers.
4. How to best exhibit speedup? Sampling large numbers of posterior networks from the previous datasets?
5. Interesting application?
